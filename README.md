Features:
- Authentication using github, which also checks against airtable that the user is authorized to view the website. By using next-auth github provider, we do not need to store user passwords in airtable (which is not secure)

TODO: 
- [ ] Add a better display for save success
- [ ] Add auth
  - [ ] (Possibly) Role based auth
- Copy and paste line for discord "ring-the-bell"
