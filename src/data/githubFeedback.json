However, this is merely a best practice and doesn’t impact how the application runs."},{"Condition":"Python env directory included in GitHub repo","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* I suggest adding `env` to `.gitignore` to reduce GitHub repo size. Since this subdirectory is built and managed by NPM from your `requirements.txt` file there’s no advantage to including it in GitHub. However, this is merely a best practice and doesn’t impact how the application runs."},{"Condition":"Update package.json to move devDependencies to be adjacent to dependencies","Importance":"Low","Feedback":"* In your `package.json` file consider moving `devDependencies` to be adjacent to `dependencies`. This is a minor change, but since the two need to be examined together during troubleshooting it’s something that could be a timesaver."},{"Condition":"devDependencies in dependencies","Importance":"Medium","Feedback":"* `@/types` dependencies should be in devDependencies, so they are not installed in production. It is also easier to manage if dependencies are categorized. You can learn more about differen types of dependencies here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18875674/whats-the-difference-between-dependencies-devdependencies-and-peerdependencie."},{"Condition":"Unused dependencies","Importance":"Medium","Feedback":"* There are unused dependencies in your package.json, such as ``. Removing unused dependencies can reduce the size of your package, which is beneficial when deploying your application. Other reasons to remove unused dependencies include - improves security, easier maintenance, faster installation and builds. You can use `depcheck` to analyze dependencies. https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck"},{"Condition":"Packages are embedded in repo","Importance":"Medium","Feedback":"* There are several libraries, like `popper.js` embedded in the repo which will greatly increase bundle size. Consider using a bundler like NPM or versions hosted on CDNs to improve initial page load time. This will also let you take advantage of any fixes and changes made by the vendor without having to redeploy your app. However, it does increase the risk of a breaking change impacting your code."},{"Condition":"Code embedded as script in HTML file","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* Javascript code is embedded in your HTML file as a <script>. It’s actually a best practice to include code as a separate file that’s referenced by a <script> tag, rather than embedding the code itself. Here’s information describing the situation in detail and how to deal with it https://www.thoughtco.com/moving-javascript-out-of-the-web-page-2037542"},{"Condition":".env file included in GitHub repo","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* App secrets are exposed in plaintext in the `.env` file. A best practice to follow is to add this file to your `.gitignore` so it’s not uploaded to GitHub. https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa "},{"Condition":"Build files included in Github repo","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* Build files like `/dist` should not be committed.

Even though this doesn’t affect the operation of the app it can make troubleshooting and debugging more difficult."},{"Condition":"Some folders/files unused","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* There are some empty or unused folders/files in your source files (such as in ``).  These placeholder folders/files should be removed if there are no plans to use them. They clutter the project directory and make it harder to navigate. They can also sometimes provide misleading information about the project status. "},{"Condition":"Good use of environment variables to protect app secrets","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* Great job using environment variables to protect app secrets, like API keys. As you know, protecting application secrets isn’t an option and is critical to protecting apps from unscrupulous hackers."},{"Condition":"Sensitive information exposed in ``","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* Sensitive information, like an API key, is exposed in plaintext in ``. Consider moving these to environment variables.  https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa"},{"Condition":"Repeated code","Importance":"Medium","Feedback":"* The itemPrice function is repeated in in both pages/Cart.js  and pages/Pdp.js . In future apps consider extracting this logic into a utility function that can be shared. This is known as the DRY principle ('Don't Repeat Yourself', and it will help make the app easier to maintain and enhance. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself"},{"Condition":"Database calls issued from FE","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* One security concern is you are directly accessing the database from the FE, rather than through a BE app server. This is a security concern since it is impossible to secure browser applications. A more secure approach is to only access your database through an API to a custom backend application server since backend servers can be secured."},{"Condition":"Good error checking","Importance":"Low","Feedback":"* You have done a very good job intercepting and handling errors in a way that provides useful information to maintainers and which allows the app to fail gracefully."},{"Condition":"Insufficient error checking","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* There is no error checking following your API call in `Dictionary.js`.

But, be aware that there are security risks associated with this function. You can learn more here --> https://www.codiga.io/blog/javascript-eval-best-practices/"},{"Condition":"Hardcoded server URL in FE ","Importance":"Low","Feedback":"* In `` you have hardcoded the URL to a BE server/service. This can increase maintenance time since a change to a URL will require updates to one or more source files + additional test time. Instead, consider placing URLs in environment variables so they can be modified with no code changes."},{"Condition":"Good attributions for copied code","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* Good work including attributions to code copied from other sources. This shows professional courtesy to other Developers and is much appreciated. "},{"Condition":"Used var instead of const/let","Importance":"Medium","Feedback":"* In `script.js` you have used `var` instead of `const/let`. This doesn’t impact how the app runs, but is a good defensive practice to adopt. This article explains the difference between the and why `const/let` is favored over `var` in modern JS. https://tinyurl.com/y5zj33d7"},{"Condition":"Nested if’s","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* Some `if` statements nested too deeply (some at 3+ levels such as in ``). This can make troubleshooting problems and adding enhancements extremely difficult. One option is to split these into smaller discrete functions."},{"Condition":"Routes, controllers & middleware logic embedded in a single server-side file.","Importance":"Medium","Feedback":"* In the BE consider isolating routes, controllers, & middleware logic into separate files in your BE.

Although there’s nothing wrong with using a library they often contain far more functions than what you need for something like this, which increases your bundle size."},{"Condition":"Switch/case statements","Importance":"Low","Feedback":"* In `` you have made effective use of switch/case statements. But, for future projects consider encoding the information in an array of JS objects and searching to find the desired result. This doesn't improve performance, but it does make for less code and is straightforward to implement."},{"Condition":"Too many global variables","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* Global variables should be avoided when possible. It should only be used for static values in most cases. Functions should return values instead of updating global values. https://www.baeldung.com/cs/global-variables"},{"Condition":"Next.js - Mixing App and Pages router","Importance":"High","Feedback":"* I noticed you are using both app and pages router. In the nextjs docs it is recommended that only use one of them. `Good to know: Although you can use both routers in the same project, routes in app will be prioritized over pages. We recommend using only one router in your new project to avoid confusion.` https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation#the-pages-directory-optional"}]},{"name":"Automated Tests","content":[{"Condition":"Good use of automated testing","Importance":"Medium","Feedback":"* You have done a good job creating automated tests to validate basic app functionality.
