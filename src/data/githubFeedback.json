As you know, protecting application secrets isn’t an option and is critical to protecting apps from unscrupulous hackers."},{"condition":"Sensitive information exposed in ``","importance":"High","feedback":"* Sensitive information, like an API key, is exposed in plaintext in ``. Consider moving these to environment variables.  https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa"},{"condition":"Repeated code","importance":"Medium","feedback":"* The itemPrice function is repeated in in both pages/Cart.js  and pages/Pdp.js . In future apps consider extracting this logic into a utility function that can be shared. This is known as the DRY principle ('Don't Repeat Yourself', and it will help make the app easier to maintain and enhance. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself"},{"condition":"Database calls issued from FE","importance":"High","feedback":"* One security concern is you are directly accessing the database from the FE, rather than through a BE app server. This is a security concern since it is impossible to secure browser applications. A more secure approach is to only access your database through an API to a custom backend application server since backend servers can be secured."},{"condition":"Good error checking","importance":"Low","feedback":"* You have done a very good job intercepting and handling errors in a way that provides useful information to maintainers and which allows the app to fail gracefully."},{"condition":"Insufficient error checking","importance":"High","feedback":"* There is no error checking following your API call in `Dictionary.js`.
